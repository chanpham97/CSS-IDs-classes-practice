# Instructions
Make a website that looks like the reference images.

## General Hints
Here are some hints for getting the websites to match
1. For the small dog breeds in purple, you should use a class
2. The image on the home page needs an ID to have separate styling from the images in the Gallery
3. You should use ID/classes to make the top p tag centered but not others.
